# GALA2
GALA v2

Oli Comments:
- Code is set up all the way to get a 2D list for each of the guests and sites specified in the GALA.inp
- Next work
  - Implement more failsafe and error codes
  - GALA.inp, if site is specified but not guest (or vise-versa), remove them from calculation
  - Need to add the write and write_smooth function to the CubeFile Class
  - add more failsafe and error handling to the maxima code
